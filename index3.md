## Current project:

### KURVS: KMOS Ultra-Deep Rotational Velocity Survey

Galaxy rotation curves provide fundamental measurements of the baryonic and dark matter distributions in galaxies. Though kinematic studies of galaxies in the local Universe revealed the need for dark matter and its’ dominance over baryonic matter, recent studies have suggested that dark matter contribution may be much lower in galaxies in the distant Universe. However, the most recent studies suffer from systematics associated with stacking analysis and small number statistics. 
The KMOS ultra-deep rotational velocity survey of high redshift (*z*∼1.5) galaxies will allow to obtain the shapes of individual rotation curves and decompose them into the stellar, gaseous and dark matter components. One of the main outcomes of survey will be testing whether there is evidence for deviation from the widely accepted ΛCDM cosmology model in the distant Universe.
